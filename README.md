Relus to followï¼š
* Key words mainly depends on your subjective judgement, the candidates in check boxes are only for reference purpose.

* As for the key words matching the image but missed in check boxes, you should manually type them.
* Each image should have 3-5 labels

The program may be stuck when you press the button, this is caused by the remote image requesting, please wait a moment ...

The "Category" and "Attribution" show some classification information and attributions, they are predicted by the [Place365 model](https://github.com/CSAILVision/places365) and are only for reference purpose, because they are not reliable enough.

When your work finished, pack the './caption_result/' to file 'start-id_end-id.zip', e.g. '10_100.zip', and upload it in [this site](http://holer.cc:50347)
